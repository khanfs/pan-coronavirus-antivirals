# QSAR Modelling of Pan-Coronavirus Antivirals Small Molecule Candidates 
This repository is the culmination of collaborative research on COVID-19 with researchers from the University of Antioquia and the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford. Research is taking on a new direction, prototyping computational biophysics algorithms that facilitate the development of pan-coronavirus antivirals. Reflecting our research on evaluating and advancing the current state-of-the-art in AI - e.g. generative biology - this repository also complements our work on developing globally accessible novel COVID-19 antiviral therapeutics.
### COVID Moonshot
With global vaccine inequality and the rapid spread of variants of concern, developing safe, globally accessible and affordable COVID-19 antiviral therapeutics is imperative. COVID Moonshot, an open drug discovery consortium, was created to tackle this challenge and is supported by the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator. This repository aims to contribute to these open-science efforts, including the COVID R&D Alliance.
### Pan-Coronavirus Antivirals
This repository explores inhibitors that could work on the family of betacoronaviruses, comprising SARS, MERS and COVID-19 - to find a pan-betacoronavirus inhibitor. Theoretically, we can thwart families of viruses by targeting their related highly conserved features (viral targets) or interfering with human pathways that viruses generally exploit to infect cells (host targets). We're formulating strategies informed by heterologous immunity. Identifying common denominators of coronaviruses for drug targets and small molecule antiviral candidates can help us to develop a  pan-betacoronavirus inhibitor.
