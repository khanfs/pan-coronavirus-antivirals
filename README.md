# QSAR Modelling of Pan-Coronavirus Antivirals Small Molecule Candidates 
This repository is the culmination of collaborative research on COVID-19 with researchers from the University of Antioquia and the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford. Research is taking on a new direction, prototyping computational biophysics algorithms that facilitate the development of pan-coronavirus antivirals. Reflecting our research on advancing the current state-of-the-art in AI - e.g. generative biology -  this repository also complements our work on developing globally accessible novel COVID-19 antiviral therapeutics.
  
### COVID Moonshot

With global vaccine inequality and the rapid spread of variants of concern, developing safe, globally accessible and affordable COVID-19 antiviral therapeutics is imperative. COVID Moonshot, an open drug discovery consortium, was created to tackle this challenge and is supported by the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator. This repository aims to contribute to this and the efforts of the COVID R&D Alliance.  

### Pan-Coronavirus Antivirals

This repository explores inhibitors that could work on the family of betacoronaviruses, comprising SARS, MERS and COVID-19 - to find a pan-betacoronavirus inhibitor. Theoretically, we can thwart viruses by targeting their related highly conserved features (viral targets) or interfering with human pathways that viruses generally exploit to infect cells (host targets), a strategy informed by heterologous immunity. We aim to identify common denominators for therapeutic targets and candidate therapeutic small molecules.
